# Maintenance

Perform maintenance on the `Dockerfile`. Update the base image digest and the pinned APT package versions together, and open a single pull request. Read the current base image, tag, and package list from the `Dockerfile`; do not assume a specific Ubuntu version or package set.

## Objective

In one pull request, for the base image and packages already declared in the `Dockerfile`:

1. Update the pinned base image digest to the latest published digest for the image and tag in the `FROM` line (for `linux/amd64`).
2. Refresh the pinned APT package versions to the latest available for that base image, preserving the current package list.

Do not assume a specific Ubuntu version or package set. Always read the current values from the `Dockerfile`.

## Required Outcome

1. Create a single maintenance branch.
2. Update the Ubuntu base image digest in the `FROM` line.
3. Update the pinned APT package versions.
4. Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
5. Push the branch and open a pull request with a clear title and description.

## Execution Steps

1. Create a maintenance branch.

```bash
git checkout -b "chore/maintenance-dockerfile-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
```

2. Update the base image digest.

- Read the base image reference (`<image>:<tag>`) from the `FROM` line in `Dockerfile`. Use whatever image and tag are currently pinned; do not assume a specific Ubuntu version.
- Pull that exact image for `linux/amd64`.

```bash
IMAGE="$(grep -oP '(?<=^FROM )[^@[:space:]]+' Dockerfile)"
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 "$IMAGE"
```

- Retrieve the current repository digest.

```bash
docker image inspect --format='{{ index .RepoDigests 0 }}' "$IMAGE"
```

- Update the `@sha256:...` digest on the `FROM` line to the new value, keeping the image and tag unchanged.

3. Update the pinned APT package versions.

- Read the list of pinned packages from the `apt-get install` block in `Dockerfile`. Use exactly that set of packages; do not add or remove any.
- Start a temporary container using the same base image and check the candidate versions for those packages.

```bash
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 "$IMAGE" \
  bash -c "apt-get update && apt-cache policy <packages-from-dockerfile>"
```

- Update each pinned version in `Dockerfile` to the reported candidate, preserving every package currently listed.

4. Confirm the `Dockerfile` still lists the same packages and the same image and tag as before (only digest and versions should differ).

5. Commit the change to `Dockerfile` using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`build` type).

6. Push the branch and open the pull request with the GitHub CLI.

- The `git commit`, `git push`, and `gh` steps need the local Git/GitHub credentials and network access. When the terminal is sandboxed these are hidden, so run these steps with the required access (outside the sandbox) rather than stopping. A sandboxed `gh auth status` may report "not logged in" even when the terminal is authenticated; do not treat that as a blocker.
- Set an explicit PR title: a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) `build:` summary that matches the commit (for example, `build: update base image digest and apt package versions`). Do not use `gh pr create --fill`, which derives the title from the branch name.
- Write the PR description to a temporary file and pass it with `--body-file` to avoid shell-escaping issues. Use Markdown, for example:
- In the PR description, wrap all SHA values (for example `sha256:...`) in backticks, including both old and new digest values in comparisons.

  ```markdown
  ## Summary

  Updates the `Dockerfile` build dependencies.

  ### Base image

  - `<image>:<tag>` digest: `sha256:<old-sha256>` -> `sha256:<new-sha256>` (image and tag unchanged)

  ### APT packages

  Include this section only when one or more package versions changed.

  | Package | Before  | After   |
  | ------- | ------- | ------- |
  | curl    | `<old>` | `<new>` |

  If no package versions changed, omit the entire `### APT packages` section (including the table) and add a single line in `## Summary`: `APT package versions already up to date.`

  Note any packages that could not be upgraded and why.

  Building and testing is handled by CI/CD.
  ```

- Create the pull request:

  ```bash
  git push -u origin <branch>
  gh pr create --base main --head <branch> --title "<title>" --body-file <body-file>
  ```

- Report the URL of the created pull request.

Building and testing the image is handled by CI/CD, so it is not part of this runbook.

## Guardrails

- Keep the base image repository and tag unchanged; derive them from the existing `FROM` line and only update the digest. Do not change the Ubuntu version.
- Keep platform assumption aligned to `linux/amd64`.
- Do not add or remove packages. Update exactly the packages already pinned in the `Dockerfile`.
- Keep all package installs pinned to explicit versions.
- Deliver both updates in the same branch and pull request.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for both the commit message and the PR title (use the `build` type).
